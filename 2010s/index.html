				<h2>Why Web Gaming Died, And How Its Coming Back</h2>
				<div class="grid"></div>
			</div>
		
			<div class="text" >In the first decade of the 21st century, web-based games had a moment.
				In 2005, Neopets reported 35 million unique monthly active players. Big game portals like Miniclip and Kongregate were recording literally billions of monthly visits. And a mix of viable business models proliferated.
					But by 2010, things had taken a turn. Mobile gaming took off, and Steve Jobs launched an attack on Adobe Flash that heralded the eventual discontinuation of a technology that was foundational for web games of the era. 
					But now, finally, new possibilities for web games are emerging. Could they be poised for a comeback?
					This week we spoke with web gaming pioneers Emily Greer (co-founder and former CEO of Kongregate), and Rob Small (co-founder and President of Miniclip), as well as a handful of startup founders on the cutting edge of the nascent web gaming renaissance. 
					That story below. But first, this week’s news from the future.</div>

		<div class="grid">Rob Small was an early believer in the potential for web games. “The idea for Miniclip began amidst the excitement of the late 1990's dot-com boom,” Small says.
			He and co-founder Tihan Presbie “saw a huge opportunity to democratize gaming across the globe by distributing games freely over the internet.”
			The company was officially founded in 2001, and quickly found a viral hit with the release of Dancing Bush, an interactive animation that allowed players to make a big-headed George W. Bush perform a variety of spins, thrusts, and screaming leaps. Small says the game clocked up over a billion plays.From there, it was off to the races. Without raising funds or spending on marketing, Small and Presbie turned Miniclip.com into a gaming empire, with over 1,000 games at its peak. Bored kids in computer labs around the world logged on and played hits like Trials Bike Pro, Heli Attack 2, and Bubble Trouble.A critical early decision by the Miniclip team was to allow people to embed any Miniclip game on their own website simply by copying-and-pasting HTML code. This effectively worked as a hack to juice Miniclip.com’s PageRank rating. “This served as a great way to boost our web traffic and SEO,” Small says, “ultimately securing us the #1 search position from the one billion pages listed under ‘Games’ on Google.”

			In 2008, Small says, Miniclip’s more “tech-savvy players started to migrate from web to mobile. At first, Small and his team were inclined to try to fight the trend, but after a couple of years they began dabbling in mobile games publishing with titles like Monster Trucks Nitro and Fragger, the latter of which went on to become one of App Store’s highest-grossing games in the first half of the 2010s. 
			Miniclip began its transformation into a mobile-first company, and was ultimately acquired by Tencent. It’s now primarily known for launching and acquiring mobile megahits like Subway Surfers, though it still operates the wildly popular web games Agar.io and 8 Ball Pool.
			It reads like a simple, straightforward story. Web games rose and fell because—while the games were sticky—mobile simply did it better. 
			But that raises some complicated questions. What were the real driving motivations, the player needs, that pushed so many tens of millions of people to play web games in the first place? And did mobile apps really meet all of those needs better? Emily Greer has a theory.
